        <h2>Caramel:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>60 g sugar</li>
            <li>90 g cream 30-35%</li>
            <li>35 g butter</li>
            <li>vanilla</li>
            <li>65g milk chocolate 44%</li>
        </ul>
       <p>
        Heat the cream almost to a boil. Melt sugar in a saucepan until caramelized. Add the hot cream to the saucepan in a few steps, stirring everything with a spatula until the lumps are dissolved.
        Add vanilla, boil for about a minute. Cool to 85C and pour over the chocolate. Stir with a blender,
        cool to 45C and add cold butter, mix again with a blender. Leave to stabilize for several hours at room temperature in a pastry bag.

        <h2>Assembling:</h2>
        <p>
            Using a pastry bag, pipe the caramel over the cookies. Sprinkle it with salt and cover with the second cookie. Sprinkle with nuts.
            Note:

            For perfect cookies or tarts, I recommend using a perforated mat
            and wire rack. In the absence of it, you can also bake simply on
            parchment paper.
            Bon appetit!
